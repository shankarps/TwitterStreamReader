# SparkDataProject

    This Spark Scala project analyzes climate information. 
    This is a beginner's project to help run several algorithms on real datasets. 

##Project Setup

    Clone the URI using "git clone" command.

##Getting the dataset
    
    The project has a dataset in the subfolder <Project_Home>/data/climate. 
     
    This is the climate data (precipitation, temperature Average, maximum and minimum) for a 115 year range (1901 - 2016) 
    for the city of Chennai, India (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai). 
    More climate datasets are available at https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets -> "Daily Summaries" -> "Search Tool". 
    Follow the instructions to select the city, data range and metrics needed.
